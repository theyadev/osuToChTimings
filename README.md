# osu! to Clone Hero Timing Converter

A tool that converts timing points (BPM changes and time signatures) from osu! beatmap files to Clone Hero chart format.

## Overview

This tool helps rhythm game chart creators by extracting BPM and time signature information from osu! beatmaps and converting them to the Clone Hero chart format. This is particularly useful when you want to recreate a song from osu! in Clone Hero while maintaining the exact same timing.

## Features

- Extracts BPM changes and time signatures from osu! beatmap files
- Converts timing points to Clone Hero's tick-based format
- Maintains accurate synchronization between the two games
- Handles multiple BPM changes and time signatures
- Outputs a properly formatted Clone Hero SyncTrack section

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

Clone this repository or download the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theyadev/osuToChTimings.git
cd osuToChTimings
```

No additional dependencies are required beyond Python's standard library.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py [input_file] [output_file]
```

### Parameters

- `input_file`: Path to the osu! beatmap file (default: "example_beatmap.osz")
- `output_file`: Path for the output file (default: "output.txt")

### Examples

Convert a specific beatmap file:

```bash
python main.py path/to/beatmap.osu output.txt
```

Using default parameters:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Output Format

The script generates a file with the following format:

```
// Generated by osu! to Clone Hero Timing Converter
// https://github.com/theyadev/osuToChTimings
[SyncTrack]
{
  0 = TS 4
  0 = B 120000
  384 = TS 3
  384 = B 180000
  // ... more timing points
}
```

This output can be directly inserted into a Clone Hero chart file (.chart).

## How It Works

1. **Extraction**: The script parses the osu! beatmap file and extracts timing points from the [TimingPoints] section
2. **Conversion**: 
   - osu! timing points (in milliseconds) are converted to Clone Hero's tick-based system
   - BPM values are calculated from osu!'s beat length values (60000/beat_length)
   - A tick rate of 192 is used (Clone Hero standard)
3. **Output**: The script generates a properly formatted SyncTrack section ready for use in Clone Hero charts

## Important Note

**For accurate timing conversion**, you must use the exact same audio file in Clone Hero as the one used in the osu! beatmap. Any differences in the audio file (different encoding, trimmed silence, etc.) will cause timing mismatches between the games.

## Common Issues

- **File format errors**: Make sure you're using a valid osu! beatmap file (.osu)
- **No timing points**: Some beatmaps might not have explicit timing points; the script will warn you if none are found
- **Tick synchronization**: Clone Hero uses 192 ticks per beat as the standard rate; this is used for conversion
- **Audio misalignment**: If the timing feels off in Clone Hero, ensure you're using the identical audio file from the osu! beatmap
