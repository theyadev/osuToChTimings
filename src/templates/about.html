    <h1>About .osu to .chart Timing Converter</h1>
    <p>
        This is a tool designed to help rhythm game charters convert timing points from osu! beatmaps to Clone Hero chart format.
        This web application makes it easy to extract BPM changes and time signatures from any osu! beatmap and generate a complete
        .chart file ready for use in Moonscraper.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct download of osu! beatmaps from the official site</li>
        <li>Automatic extraction of timing data from .osu files</li>
        <li>Precise conversion of osu! timing points to .chart's tick-based format</li>
        <li>Supports multiple BPM changes and time signatures</li>
        <li>Generates complete .chart files with metadata</li>
        <li>Provides audio file download from the beatmap</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Downloading:</strong> The application downloads the beatmap from the osu! website.</li>
        <li><strong>Extraction:</strong> It extracts the .osu file and audio from the downloaded beatmap package.</li>
        <li><strong>Parsing:</strong> The application parses the timing points and metadata from the .osu file.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> osu! timing points (in milliseconds) are converted to chart's tick-based system using a formula that ensures precise alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> The application generates a complete .chart file with SyncTrack section and proper metadata.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>
        osu! stores timing information in milliseconds, while .chart uses a tick-based system (192 ticks per beat by default).
        The conversion process calculates the exact tick positions based on elapsed time and BPM changes to ensure accurate timing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The formula used for conversion is: <code>ticks = elapsed_minutes * BPM * tick_rate</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        For negative timing points in osu! files (which can occur in some beatmaps), the converter handles them by moving them to the earliest
        equivalent position in the .chart file, as .chart does not support negative ticks.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Common Issues</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bad beatmap quality:</strong> If the original osu! beatmap has poor timing quality, these inaccuracies will be carried over to the .chart file; choose well-timed beatmaps (ranked, qualified, loved) for best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio misalignment:</strong> If the timing feels off in your editor, ensure you're using the identical audio file from the osu! beatmap.</li>
        <li><strong>Server limitations:</strong> Very large beatmaps might time out or fail to process due to serverless function limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative timing points:</strong> The tool handles negative timing points by moving them to the closest equivalent position, which might not be 100% accurate.</li>
    </ul>
